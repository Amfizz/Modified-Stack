# Modified-Stack
As my final DLD project I was thrilled to make this project of Modified Stack. I have always heard how stack works by pushing and popping from the top but this project made me look into deep working behind it and enabled me to learn various new things about stack. This repository provides you with complete description and cc file of stack.
